* The interwikis for all Special pages is a failed proposal with consensus being mainly against it.
* The proposal for none of the interwikis is a failed proposal with around 45% consensus in favour.
* For some interwiki links on Special pages does not have enough discussion but it can see it is a far too broad proposal as-is.
** Special:RecentChanges is a failed proposal with a vote-based conclusion with consensus at 52% however argument based; it is a passed proposal. All the comments in regards to Legoktm’s argument are ignore mainly due to the fact it is a design of a skin used by a small population of Wikimedia users and alone is a some-what old skin. Design factors of old skins should not steer consensus of entire projects.
** Special:Watchlist is a failed proposal. Even counting is design aspects, 300+ links on Special:Watchlist is not necessarily useful and probably not something Wikidata should be handling at this time.
