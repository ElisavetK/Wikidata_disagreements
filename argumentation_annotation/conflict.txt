I am well aware of the difference between ’’data’’ and ’’information’’. Nevertheless, I decided to use the terms as synonyms in this case to keep the discussion open to non-specialists and avoid excessive technicalities. The choice of using the two terms without making any distinction is by the way common also to part of the scientific literature.--[[User:Alessandro Piscopo|Alessandro Piscopo]

Are you really saying that ""References should be sources recognised as impartial and authoritative. E.g. for demographic data, census governmental sources are considered as trustworthy"" isn’t claiming that census government sources are impartial? That seems to me like a nonstandard usage of ""E.g.""

I have also politely asked [[User:Nikkimaria]] to migrate the Findagrave links she is fervently deleting at Wikipedia to Wikidata, before the information is lost. So far, she has not migrated any data, but continues to delete the information at Wikipedia. I think it had the opposite effect and caused her to start to ’’delete the information here at Wikidata’’ also. Can someone convince her of the importance of not losing the data? Is there anyway to see how much information she lost?

* Findagrave is an unreliable source of information and should not be used. Photos of gravestones are not citable sources. Wikidata links to countless other knowledge bases, if you need to rely on Findagrave you aren’t trying hard enough.

::::::: You used the same argument before at the IMDB discussion, so I will use the my same counter argument. You wrote: ""That’s not how this works"" This isn’t about what ’’I’’ think, or what ’’you’’ think. It is based on community consensus, if you want to change that consensus, you will have to persuade the community with statistics, not with emotions and anecdotes.
