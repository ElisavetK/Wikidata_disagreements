Did I misunderstand that the proposition was mainly a means to remove the less prominent/relevant student-relations. Are you suggesting to move each current claim as a first step, to prevent new students added and the ""relevance"" evaluated over time, or that the evaluation of relevance performed before the move? Isn’t the problem in that case that {{P|P1066}} will still be overused? 
*:: {{Ping|Nomen ad hoc}} Did you also have feedback on these questions?
Reference 2 - 1.96% Coverage
When you say ""without loss"", are you disagreeing that the student property is overused or do you just want to make sure that the ’’important students’’ are not lost? Would it be feasible to use {{P|P1066}} in infobox if that was complete enough?

How does Connectedness differ from Interlinking? Would you join these two dimensions?-
Reference 2 - 0.45% Coverage
I fail to understand this one. External identifiers are data in itself, giving links to other datasets, and so yielding more ""interlinking"" (one of the suggested dimensions). They may or may not even be source of ""content data"". So perhaps you can clarify more extensively what you mean here? [

Reference 2 - 0.93% Coverage
It is very difficult to form an opinion based on the scarce input which was given in this RfC until now. I do not see a problem with “community sourced” databases in general, so do we have any statistical information about data quality in FindAGrave that implies serious concerns? Which Wikipedias consider this source unreliable, and where do I find relevant discussions?
Reference 3 - 1.08% Coverage
*** [[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] the Help page suggests to *replace* wikipedia links with more verifiable source links, not to delete them without adding a source.
