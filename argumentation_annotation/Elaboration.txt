Here’s a new reason it should be deleted: It’s use cannot be verified. Based on the discussion currently ongoing at [[WD:Project chat]], if we can’t verify a claim, then we probably shouldn’t make it. In that event then, P107 is tying us to an ontology which has not claimed to represent the million or so items which P107 is now on. I.e., it is not verifiable. On top of this, P107 can ’’only’’ be verified where there is already a GND ID. That fact makes it even useless for the cases where it can be verified, as the type can be gotten from querying the database if the type is even desirable for someone in those cases; its nonuse on en.wiki would indicate that that is not the case for our primary external users.<p>This is besides its other salient points for deletion, which are numerous and continuing to cause us problems in other ways. We should cease pretending like this is a good property.

I’ve looked at several open data sets related to administrative hierarchies last year from the point of view of building a reverse geocoder that can come up with the correct colloquial names for neighborhoods and areas. This requires both good data on boundaries and names of places. This is an extremely hard problem and the open data for this is highly fragmented across many datasets that add to the problem with problematic categorizations, a bias towards formal administrative names rather than the informal names that people actually use in real life, a lack of good data on boundaries, completeness and correctness of the data, and data licensing. E.g. open street maps is surprisingly useless for this problem since it only includes a few tens of thousands of boundaries for administrative hierarchies world wide. Foursquare made a rather heroic effort to unite several datasets worldwide including geonames, geoplanet and countless open datasets for specific regions. The result is published at quatroshapes.org. I believe wiki data can contribute in several ways. 1) where possible link to other datasets. A good start would be importing geoplanet woeids and geoname ids on dataitems where possible. I estimate that approximately 500000 wikipedia articles are linked directly from the geonames dataset already and there exist mappings to geoplanet as well. 2) adopt a categorization similar to geoplanet to distinguish e.g. places that have historical meaning (e.g. weimar republic) from formal names such as Bezirk Pankow, which contains several areas with less formal names. Geoplanet data has been archived at the internet archive and is available under cc 3.0 with attribution, if I remember correctly. 3) consider supporting geojson for describing boundaries and other geographic features. Coordinates only have limited use (positioning a map) and good polygon data would be very valuable. 4) identify problems in the data and seek community support for filling the gaps. For example good open neighborhood data is available for large parts of northern America but very hard to come by for e.g. Germany. There are currently no good datasets with global

I think that what ""deserves"" to be included in Wikidata, i.e. the notability policy and consequently the concept of completeness, defines the aim itself of the project. This is a topic much greater than this discussion, I believe. For this reason, it could be useful to define a level of completeness that the community thinks it fits the possible uses of Wikidata (well, also this point could be debated a lot, but perhaps it is simpler). 
::: With regard to [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]]’s remarks about the approach to be followed, this is actually the goal of this RfC and of our research. We would like to understand what quality means to Wikidata, which dimensions are important, and how we define them in order to successively build some metrics to measure the issues deemed as the most relevant by the community.

I think that almost [[:Category:Constraint templates|all current constraints]] try to spot Consistency issues. But many of these soft constraints, when they are marked as mandatory, are only acting as community-driven patches to try to solve Wikidata structural deficiencies. For example, duplicating information is one of the worst things to do in a database, and this is possible, even demanded, in Wikidata on properties with the {{tl|Constraint:Symmetric}}. Wikidata should ensure (but is currently not ensuring) by itself the accomplishment of this constraint by automatically adding (B.propertyX := A) every time that (A.propertyX := B) is defined by a user, where propertyX is a property with a mandatory Constraint:Symmetric. The same with {{tl|Constraint:Inverse}}, mutatis mutandis. These soft constraints are currently not implemented as a part of the Wikidata interface, so well-known inconsistencies [[Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/Mandatory constraints/Violations|grow dangerously over time]] and the Wikidata community cannot avoid this data degradation by now.
::Apart from linked constraints:
::* we shouldn’t let users include URLs that point to non-existent or non-accesible resources (for example, to pages that return a 404 error) as values for properties like {{P|2002}} (external identifier) or {{P|856}} (URL);
::* we should use unit conversion to avoid inconsistencies as it would let us define range limits not only focused on numbers, but also on what these numbers mean with their units;
::* we should limit quantity properties to integers when needed (see [[phab:T112247]]);
::* we should only create couples of equal items on certain properties ({{Q|Q7810}} can be the {{P|26}} of {{Q|Q7828}}, and {{Q|Q76}} can be the {{P|26}} of {{Q|Q13133}}, but {{Q|Q7810}} cannot be the {{P|26}} of {{Q|Q13133}} as both are instances of different items);
::* we should avoid that an item A can be a value for two incompatible or redundant properties on an item B (for example, {{Q|Q19943}} should not be marked as {{P|22}} of {{Q|Q191045}} and as {{P|1038}} of {{Q|Q191045}} at the same time);
::* we could force users to define properties {{P|31}} or {{P|279}} for any new item.

Alessandro Piscopo is an academic who wants to study Wikidata. He’s not WMDE employee of as far as I can see is payed by a Wikimedia grant.

In this case publishing work about data quality that shows that Wikidata cares about data quality in a venue that people who care about open data read, makes it more likely that they consider Wikidata a serious project and donate their data to it.

Academic work does not need to have direct practical implications, but – I believe – it should always take them into account and aim at concrete effects on things. I would not even find it totally correct to ask the Wikidata community to discuss this draft, if I did not think that it could be one day adopted (even partially) by Wikidata or at least be directly beneficial to it. So yes, it will be good if the outcome of this work will be published, it will be better it this will bring someone to donate to Wikidata, and it will be even better if quality measures will be developed and then used, based on this framework. And by the way, no, I do not get any Wikimedia grant :)

{{support}} I perfectly agree about the proposal of sorting identifiers in some way, in order to make it easier to find them. At the moment the sorting of all properties is managed through [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]], {{ping|ArthurPSmith}}; the only identifier which is sorted at the moment is {{P|214}}, which is set to appear first, {{ping|Ghouston}}, as a result of [[Wikidata:Requests for comment/Sort identifier statements on items that are instances of human|this RFC]] which has just closed (to be more precise: the RFC resulted in a consensus to have VIAF as first identifier on human items; however, Wikibase-SortedProperties doesn’t have the possibility to restrict a sorting to a class of items at the moment, so I had to enforce the sorting on all items).

** If you look at the labels on something like {{P|698}}, it’s basically ""PubMed"" in any Latin-scripted language. Some are using variants like ""identificador Pubmed"", and you’d still want to sort that under ""P"", not ""i"". So sorting by the English label would generally work in this case. I don’t know about Arabic, Chinese, etc

*** @[[User:Ghouston|Ghouston]]: As far as I’m aware a lot of {{P|698}} labels (other than en) start with ’’ident’’*. I think this is true for a bulk of other external ids.

Please apply any type of sorting as soon as possible, in order to have items with so many identifiers comparable. It is not actually important what type of sorting we have, currently there is no any and that is a shame for Wikidata that promises structured and not mixed up data.
:And btw, please link somehow pencil link in Authority control and Official website templates on Wikipedia lead to Identifiers and Official website identifier/property if possible for the latter (if not then that one too to identifiers section because it is there where is website located, AC elements of course all are in Identifiers section and currently pencil just leads us to item on Wikidata and hover text says edit on Wikidata but one cannot immediately find it to edit it here). --

# As can be seen in the [[#Summary of previous comments|summary]], most users (among which me) strongly preferred a sorting which would take into account each user’s interface language; unfortunately, [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] (the only way to sort properties at the moment) doesn’t allow such a solution, so English has seemed to me (and to the users who supported my proposal) the best compromise
:*# """"Most important identifiers first"" makes an assumption about what’s important"": it’s perfectly true, opinions about ""most important identifiers"" can differ; if you have an alternative proposal for sorting, this can be voted of course (I numbered my proposal as ""1"" because I supposed other proposals would be made); talking specifically about VIAF, its first position hasn’t been decided here, but [[Sort identifier statements on items that are instances of human|here]] (the RfC regarded only humans, but again [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] at the moment doesn’t allow such a solution which differentiates sorting on the basis of {{P|31}}, so it was applied to all items), and the only objection which has been made has been ""{{P|846}} has more ids at hand than {{P|214}}"", which is true but in fact doesn’t matter, because there is no item which has both properties. I know VIAF has many problems of clustering (we are trying to list them [[Wikidata:WikiProject Authority control/VIAF errors|here]]), but I think that the majority of the clusters is substantially OK.
:*# Yes, I know each new property and each English label modification should be added manually; however, it wouldn’t probably be impossible to have it done periodically by an admin-bot (I will [[Wikidata:Bot requests|make a request]] if we decide to keep proposal 1). Of course something automatic would be much better, but again [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] doesn’t allow such a solution at the moment.
::Finally, I would certainly approve making this sorting an opt-in; however, again, [[MediaWiki:Wikibase-SortedProperties]] doesn’t allow such a solution at the moment. If you want to set your own order for identifiers, you can try [[User:Bargioni/personal sort identifiers.js]] - you can set an order for the identifiers, all the identifiers you don’t mention will appear sorted by P number. I finally ask {{ping|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)}} to check all my claims about ""doesn’t allow such a solution""

{Ping|Pigsonthewing}} Mixer is the second most well known streaming service after Twitch. Both speedrun and HLTB are related to completion times with the former being more specific. Gamepedia tends to be of much higher quality than Fandom Wikia and are steadily becoming the more popular option. Comic Vine is a spin-off of Giant Bomb with both sharing similar layout. -

::Yes, multiple statements can work. But I thought the ""key event"" proposal is trying to combine different aspects (e.g. date and place) of an event (e.g. birth) together, such as:
:::* <person X> ’’key event’’ <birth>, qualifiers: <place>, <date>
:::Using multiple statements means we have to separate them (otherwise we will have redundant data) such as:
:::* <person X> ’’key event’’ 1 <birth>, qualifier: <date 1>
:::* <person X> ’’key event’’ 2 <birth>, qualifier: <date 2>
:::* <person X> ’’key event’’ 3 <birth>, qualifier: <place 1>
:::* <person X> ’’key event’’ 4 <birth>, qualifier: <place 2>
:::I’m not saying it’s a bad idea, just not what I thought.

I don’t think because the property proposal says ""For building and structures, rather use {{P|P84}} or {{P|P631}}. See also {{P|P176}}."

A software developer is a person who is involved in the design, construction of a model/prototype, pseudocode, then actual computer code. A programmer is a person who writes computer programs. Also called a coder, he/she is already given the design of the software he/she is building, to begin with. The coder needs to be only aware of the actual machine/platform that will run the code.
