Well, we shouldn’t delete this until we have a good replacement for it

After the info is gone and it’s harder to restore... not a very good idea

{{keep}} It’s the most used property and as well as the skeleton of wikidata properties
Reference 4 - 0.77% Coverage
{{keep}}, useful property. But we must not extend it by additional values.
Reference 5 - 1.58% Coverage
{{keep}} The classification can certainly be improved, but I do not see any advantage in deleting it. It remains an effective way to quickly define an item

Reference 3 - 0.10% Coverage
{{Keep}} Useful

That’s not a ""rule"", it’s merely a part of a help page, and one which is clearly out-of-step with current common practise, at that.

Reference 3 - 0.60% Coverage
* Findagrave is an unreliable source of information and should not be used. Photos of gravestones are not citable sources. Wikidata links to countless other knowledge bases, if you need to rely on Findagrave you aren’t trying hard enough.
